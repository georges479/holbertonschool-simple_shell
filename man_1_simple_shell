.TH HSH 1 "April 2025" "Simple Shell" "User Commands"

.SH NAME
hsh - a simple command line interpreter (shell)

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./hsh

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a simple command line interpreter that executes commands read from standard input.
It is designed to mimic basic functionality of the sh shell.

.SH INVOCATION
.B hsh
can be invoked both interactively and non-interactively.

If
.B hsh
is invoked with standard input connected to a terminal, it reads commands interactively.

If standard input is not connected to a terminal, it reads commands from standard input and executes them.

.SH COMMANDS
The shell interprets the words it reads as commands and arguments.

.B Built-in commands:
.TP
.B exit
Exit the shell.
.TP
.B env
Print the current environment variables.

.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
After a command has been split into words, if it contains no slashes, the shell searches for it in the list of built-in commands. If the command is not a built-in, the shell searches each element of the PATH environment variable for a directory containing an executable file by that name.

If the command name contains a slash, the shell executes it directly.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The environment is initially inherited from the shell's parent process. When a program is executed, the environment is passed to the program.

.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status of the shell is the exit status of the last command executed.
